Double-Booked: A Chrome app for doing double-entry accounting.

This is a Chrome app (a packaged app, specifically) for doing
double-entry accounting.  It is inspired by the command-line
program Ledger (http://ledger-cli.org/) but designed to be
web-based.  My goals are:

- Easy to add your accounts one-by-one.  Ledger puts transactions
  for all accounts in the same file, which makes you merge this
  file a lot as you add accounts.

- Balance transactions as you go.  Double-entry accounting dictates
  that all transactions must balance, but this can be problematic
  if you are importing accounts one by one.  Double-Booked will
  let you enter transactions that don't balance, letting you balance
  them later once you've created/imported the other account.

- Sync your data to the cloud, but cache it locally for performance
  and offline access.  Current plan is to sync to your Dropbox
  account so you don't have to trust your data to me.

- Rich visualizations and reports.  Using the rendering engine of
  HTML5 and SVG, the sky is the limit.  And programmers should be
  able to write their own easily.

- Lots of import options.  Import from Mint, OFX, etc. or from your
  bank's website directly (but this would happen in your own browser,
  so you aren't sending your data anywhere).

The technologies used are:

- Chrome packaged web apps, which let you "install" the app into your
  browser (all application code is downloaded and lives on your computer).
  That way I don't have to run any servers and you don't have to trust me
  with your data.

- HTML5 local storage, for storing your account data locally.

- Dropbox? for syncing your data to the cloud.

- d3 for elegantly expressing data-driven manipulations of the DOM.
